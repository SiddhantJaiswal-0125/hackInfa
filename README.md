* Star this Repo. if you like the app & support me, this keeps me motivated and keep going for further development

A Mobile +  Web Application where the user can upload its important file very securely and can provide access to limited users who can access the file all around the world through this application.
It uses realtime database to provide a better user experience.

Going with Flutter is a easy choice with its quick development time and fast execution times.
Firebase as the backend and storage solution makes it very easy to scale .

# ðŸ”¥ Our Pitch
Our application is the one stop solution for sharing files secretly with proper safety.
It uses advance and very reliable technology as a service provider to provide proper security for the files of the user.


# ðŸ”¦ Any other specific thing you want to highlight?
- This idea is completely feasible as of now because the technology stack used is cross platform allowing reach for a larger number of audience

- The backend can be scaled up infinitely to match the scale of audience required to carter using the industry standard technologies like Kubernetes. The same is true for the no-sql database mongodb that can be scaled horizontally using concepts of sharding.
- Some of our **Future Aspects**

   - Encrypt the File using some Encryption Algorithm.
   - Multiple UI-Themes.
   - Add realtime alert messages on data-access by others.
   - Add inbuilt App-Lock features.
